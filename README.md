# sarcasm_detection_in_user_reviews
# Overview



This package contains the data and code necessary to replicate the experiments conducted in the study of sarcasm detection in text data. There are two main experiments: binary classification and multiclassification of sarcasm.

# Directory Structure
# Data Files:
Sarcasm_multiclassification.csv - Dataset used for multiclass sarcasm detection.
annotated_comments_binary.csv - Dataset used for binary sarcasm detection.
# Code Files:
GRU, BiGRU, CNN_for multiclassification_sarcasm.ipynb - Jupyter notebook for multiclass sarcasm detection using GRU, BiGRU, and CNN models.
LSTM, BILSTM_Multi_classification_sarcasm.ipynb - Jupyter notebook for multiclass sarcasm detection using LSTM and BiLSTM models.
RNN_BiRNN_MultiClassification_sarcasm__Dataset.ipynb - Jupyter notebook for multiclass sarcasm detection using RNN and BiRNN models.
# Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, keras, tensorflow
# Running the Experiments
# Binary Classification:
Open annotated_comments_binary.csv for data overview.
Run notebooks inside the binary classification updated folder (specific notebooks to be listed here).
# Multiclass Classification:
Open the Sarcasm_multiclassification.csv for data overview.
# Choose and run one of the following notebooks based on the desired model:
GRU, BiGRU, CNN_for multiclassification_sarcasm.ipynb
LSTM, BILSTM_Multi_classification_sarcasm.ipynb
RNN_BiRNN_MultiClassification_sarcasm__Dataset.ipynb
# Data Description
Sarcasm_multiclassification.csv contains multiple labels per comment for sarcasm detection.
annotated_comments_binary.csv contains binary labels (sarcasm or not) per comment.
